BRIEF:

DS1 Encryption is ideally suited to Secure the Digital Transfer of Information on Public 
Networks such as the Internet. 
The DS1 Coding Technique can output 1,078,203,909,375 different Encrypted byte streams from just 
one input stream. Therefore even if the same data is transmitted again it will not 
look the same.

TECHNIQUES USED:
This is achieved by selecting 5 random bytes and adding them to the start of the byte 
stream. The byte stream then undergoes CBC (Cipher Block Chaining),byte & bit level processing before being 
outputted as 1 of the 1,078,203,909,375 different possible byte outputs. 

=NOTE=

Due to Salt Code Up-dates, Encrypted Data (File/ByteStreams) with DS1 Encryption (Ver 1.3) are NOT compatable with prior releases.

*VERSION INFOMATION*
--------------------
Ver1.5
Optimsed module by David Greenwood, 4MB/sec achieved in Pure VB Code ! New style cipher,
still includes features of previous cipher but much improved security & speed. CBF techniques are now used in conjunction with CBC techniques to improve the cipher.

Ver1.3
Optimised module by David Midkiff but re-inforced cipher block chain coding and 
n level bit-shifting increasing the variance of outputed code. Also strconv added to Key varible in string & file functions to remove unicoding which isserts 0's into the string. This makes the key more secure.

Ver1.2

Optimised Coding by David Midkiff, New Demonstration Project Re-built to include new Optimised Coding. Many thanks to David Midkiff for his additions to the project.

Ver1.1

Salt Coding Up-date: Salt Coding has been improved to increase possible byte outputs from 16,777,216 to
		     1,078,203,909,375.
Optimisation:        Salt Coding has been optimised speeding encryption by 200% during encrypt &
		     decrypt.

Ver1.0
